    <p>In the <a href="https://sbrisard.github.io/posts/20200402-what_is_homogenization-01.html">previous
instalment</a> of this
series, we introduced homogenization and the separation of scales. In
the present post, we will discuss two strategies to carry out
homogenization: the experimental and the theoretical approaches. To do
so, we will again use the analogy with the halftoning technique.</p>
<p>Remember that we considered the following picture, reproduced from <em>Le
Journal</em> (thursday, may 30<sup>th</sup>, 1935).</p>
<p><img alt="The first cruise of the ocean liner Normandie." class="figure" src="https://sbrisard.github.io/posts/What_is_homogenization/Normandie.jpg"></p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the prow:</p>
<p><img alt="Close-up of the prow" class="figure" src="https://sbrisard.github.io/posts/What_is_homogenization/Normandie-400x300.png"></p>
<p>we realized that what <em>looked like</em> shades of gray in the photograph
was actually a <em>dotted</em> structure. This dotted structure will be
called the <em>microstructure</em>; its typical length-scale is the
<em>microscopic</em> length-scale $L_\mu$ that was introduced before.</p>
<p>Now, let us imagine what happened when this photograph was actually
printed alongside the article about the launch of the ocean liner
<em>Normandie</em>. The printer was handed out the original photograph (which
is indeed made of shades of grays, <em>not black dots</em>) and had to pick
the dot pattern(s) that would result in the best halftone reproduction
of the photograph. To do so, he needed a rule that relates the dot
pattern to the resulting shade of gray.</p>
<p>This is what homogenization is really about: <strong>homogenization provides a
mapping from the <em>microstructure</em> to the <em>effective properties</em></strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Experimental homogenization" class="fig30p100" src="https://sbrisard.github.io/posts/What_is_homogenization/experimental_homogenization.png"></p>
<p>Our friend the printer first performed the required homogenization
step <em>experimentally</em>. As the problem at hand is about human
perception, he asked his apprentice to be the subject of his
experiment. He handed out a set of cards, uniformly coloured with
various shades of gray, to the apprentice. Then, he presented him with
various dot patterns. For each of these patterns, the printer asked
the apprentice to pick the card that was closest to how he perceived
the pattern. The printer was then able to build a chart that related
pattern to shade of gray (and vice-versa).</p>
<p>But then, the printer realized that this experiment is fundamentally
subjective. In order to be <em>statistically representative</em>, he needed
to repeat this experiment with many subjects, and compute some kind of
average. He thought that this was quite tedious, and maybe there was
another strategy.</p>
<p>In fact, there <em>is</em> another strategy, which is called <em>upscaling</em>. In
this approach, the effective properties are <em>inferred</em> (through a
mathematical model) from the microstructure. In the case of
halftoning, the mathematical model is rather simple, as it boils down
to a simple average. More precisely, we first need to realize that the
dot pattern is <em>periodic</em>: it is the result of paving the plane with a
single <em>unit-cell</em>, a hexagon in the present case (see figure below,
where the unit-cell is shown in gray).</p>
<p><img alt="The unit-cell" class="fig30p100" src="https://sbrisard.github.io/posts/What_is_homogenization/unit-cell.png"></p>
<p>The total surface area of the unit-cell is $A$, and the surface area
covered by the black dot(s) is $A_{\mathrm{b}}$. The surface area
$A_{\mathrm{w}}=A-A_{\mathrm{b}}$ remains white. Then, the upscaling
rule reads</p>
<p>$$G^{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{A_{\mathrm{w}}}{A},$$</p>
<p>where $0\leq G^{\mathrm{eff}}\leq 1$ denotes the <em>effective</em> gray
level ($G^{\mathrm{eff}}=0$: black; $G^{\mathrm{eff}}=1$: white). The
above upscaling rule can be seen as a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_mixtures">rule of
mixtures</a>. Indeed, let
$G_{\mathrm{b}}=0$ and $G_{\mathrm{w}}=1$ denote the gray levels of
black and white, respectively. Then, the effective gray level is
expressed as the following weighted average of the local gray levels</p>
<p>$$G = \frac{A_{\mathrm{b}}}{A} G_{\mathrm{b}}+\frac{A_{\mathrm{w}}}{A} G_{\mathrm{w}},$$</p>
<p>where the weights are the surface fractions. This is in fact a rare
example where the rule of mixtures gives the correct answer! It is
time to wrap up.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Homogenization is the process that relates the microstructure to the
macroscopic properties. This relationship can be established
experimentally or theoretically. These two strategies should not be
seen as competing, but rather as complementary approaches to the same
problem.</p>
<p>On the one hand, provided that the experiments are performed
correctly, the experimental approach always delivers the “correct”
answer. However, a new experiment is required for each new
microstructure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, theoretical (upscaling) approaches have the ability
to be <em>predictive</em>: given the microstructure, the effective properties
can be computed with no need to actually <em>build</em> the
microstructure. This is particularly desirable in an industrial
context, where numerical modelling is gradually supplanting physical
testing. The downside is that all the relevant physics must be
accounted for <em>at the scale of the microstructure</em>. While this is
relatively easy in the case of e.g. linear elasticity of composites,
it is a much more difficult task in the case of e.g. linear elasticity
of unsaturated porous media, where we need to account for all menisci.</p>
<p>In my research, I preferably resort to theoretical homogenization, to
which the remainder of this series will be devoted. In the <a href="https://sbrisard.github.io/posts/20200421-what_is_homogenization-03.html">next
instalment</a>, we will
discuss periodic vs. random homogenization.</p>
