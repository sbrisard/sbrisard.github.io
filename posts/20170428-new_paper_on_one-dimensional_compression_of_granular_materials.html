    <p>My student Mohamed Hassan Khalili has recently had one of his papers
published in <em>Physical Review E</em>. The paper is called “A numerical study
of one-dimensional compression of granular materials”. I have only been
very marginally involved in this DEM study, which is divided in two
parts.</p>
<p>Part I is entitled “Stress-strain behavior, microstructure and
irreversibility”. The abstract is reproduced below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The behavior of a model granular material, made of slightly
polydisperse beads with Hertz-Mindlin elastic-frictional contacts, in
oedometric compression (i.e., compression along one axis, with no
lateral strain) is studied by grain-level numerical simulations. We
systematically investigate the influence of the (idealized) packing
process on the microstructure and stresses in the initial, weakly
confined equilibrium state, and prepare both isotropic and anisotropic
configurations differing in solid fraction Φ and coordination number
z. Φ (ranging from maximally dense to moderately loose), z (which
might vary independently of Φ in dense systems), fabric and force
anisotropy parameters, and the ratio K₀ of lateral stresses σ₂=σ₃ to
stress σ₁ in the compression direction are monitored in oedometric
compression in which σ₁ varies by more than three orders of magnitude.
K₀ reflects the anisotropy of the assembling process and may remain
nearly constant in further loading if the material is already
oedometrically compressed (as a granular gas) in the preparation
stage. Otherwise, it tends to decrease steadily over the investigated
stress range. It is related to force and fabric anisotropy parameters
by a simple formula. Elastic moduli, separately computed with an
appropriate matrix method, may express the response to very small
stress increments about the transversely isotropic well-equilibrated
states along the loading path, although oedometric compression proves
an essentially anelastic process, mainly due to friction mobilization,
with large irreversible effects apparent upon unloading. While the
evolution of axial strain ε₁ and solid fraction Φ (or of the void
ratio e=−1+1/Φ) with axial stress σ₁ is very nearly reversible,
especially in dense samples, z is observed to decrease (as previously
observed in isotropic compression) after a compression cycle if its
initial value was high. K₀ relates to the evolution of internal
variables and may exceed 1 in unloading. The considerably greater
irreversibility of oedometric compression reported in sands, compared
to our model systems, should signal contact plasticity or damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The preprint is available on
<a href="https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01497636">HAL</a> and the
published version is available
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032907">here</a>.</p>
<p>Part II is entitled “Elastic moduli, stresses and microstructure”. The
abstract is reproduced below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The elastic moduli of a transversely isotropic model granular
material, made of slightly polydisperse elastic-frictional spherical
beads, in equilibrium along a one-dimensional (oedometric) compression
path, as described in the companion paper [M. H. Khalili et al.,
Phys. Rev. E 95, 032907 (2017)], are investigated by numerical
simulations. The relations of the five independent moduli to stresses,
density, coordination number, fabric and force anisotropies are
studied for different internal material states along the oedometric
loading path. It is observed that elastic moduli, as in isotropic
packs, are primarily determined by the coordination number, with
anomalously small shear moduli in poorly coordinated systems, whatever
their density. Such states also exhibit faster increasing moduli in
compression, and larger off-diagonal moduli and Poisson ratios.
Anisotropy affects the longitudinal moduli C₁₁ in the axial direction
and C₂₂ in the transverse directions, and the shear modulus in the
transverse plane C₄₄, more than the shear modulus in a plane
containing the axial direction C₅₅. The results are compared to
available experiments on anisotropic bead packs, revealing, despite
likely differences in internal states, a very similar range of
stiffness level (linked to coordination), and semiquantitative
agreement as regards the influence of anisotropy. Effective medium
theory (the Voigt approach) provides quite inaccurate predictions of
the moduli. It also significantly underestimates ratios C₁₁/C₂₂
(varying between 1 and 2.2) and C₅₅/C₄₄ (varying from 1 to 1.6), which
characterize elastic anisotropy, except in relatively weakly
anisotropic states. The bulk modulus for isotropic compression and the
compliance corresponding to stress increments proportional to the
previous stress values are the only elastic coefficients to be
correctly estimated by available predictive relations. We discuss the
influences of fabric and force anisotropies onto elastic anisotropy,
showing in particular that the former dominates in sample series that
are directly assembled in anisotropic configurations and keep a
roughly constant lateral to axial stress ratio under compression.</p>
