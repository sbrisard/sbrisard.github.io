  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Together with our post-doctoral fellow Othmane Zerhouni, my colleague
<a href="http://kostasdanas.com/">Kostas Danas</a>
(<a href="https://portail.polytechnique.edu/lms/en">LMS</a>, <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en">École
polytechnique</a>) and I have recently
published a new paper in <em>International Journal of Engineering
Science</em>. The paper is titled “Quantifying the effect of two-point
correlations on the effective elasticity of specific classes of random
porous materials with and without connectivity”. The abstract is
reproduced below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is well-known by now that the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds imply that the
two-point correlation functions are not in general sufficient to estimate
accurately the response of composites, especially when their underlying phases
exhibit infinite contrast, e.g., porous materials. Starting from this
longstanding, albeit qualitative result, this work investigates quantitatively
the relevance of using two-point correlations to model the effective elastic
properties of specific isotropic porous materials with and without
connectivity. To achieve this in an unambiguous manner, we propose three
different microstructures that share almost identical two-point statistics by
design but are rather different morphologically. The choice of these
microstructures is driven by their wide use in several practical problems
ranging from polymers to geomaterials. The first microstructure is obtained by
a random sequential adsorption (RSA) of non-overlapping, polydisperse,
spherical and ellipsoidal voids oriented randomly in a unit-cell. The second
one, termed connected random sequential adsorption (CRSA), is obtained from
the first one by adding controlled connectivity via cylindrical channels of
circular cross-section. The porosity resulting from connectivity is
compensated by reducing the size of the existing voids to have the same
overall porosity. Interestingly, we find that connectivity does not affect the
corresponding two-point statistics. Finally, using as an input the numerical
one- and two-point correlations of the RSA, we reconstruct a thresholded
Gaussian random field (TGRF) microstructure. Using FFT numerical simulations,
we show that the resulting effective elastic properties are very different for
the three generated microstructures, despite them sharing nearly the same
two-point correlation functions. We show, further, that the introduction of
connectivity, and in particular the partial volume fraction of the connected
channels, even small, affects strongly the resulting effective elasticity of
the composite.</p>
