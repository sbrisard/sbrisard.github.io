Together with our post-doctoral fellow Othmane Zerhouni, my colleague
[Kostas Danas](http://kostasdanas.com/)
([LMS](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/lms/en), [École
polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en)) and I have recently
published a new paper in *International Journal of Engineering
Science*. The paper is titled “Quantifying the effect of two-point
correlations on the effective elasticity of specific classes of random
porous materials with and without connectivity”. The abstract is
reproduced below.

> It is well-known by now that the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds imply that the
> two-point correlation functions are not in general sufficient to estimate
> accurately the response of composites, especially when their underlying phases
> exhibit infinite contrast, e.g., porous materials. Starting from this
> longstanding, albeit qualitative result, this work investigates quantitatively
> the relevance of using two-point correlations to model the effective elastic
> properties of specific isotropic porous materials with and without
> connectivity. To achieve this in an unambiguous manner, we propose three
> different microstructures that share almost identical two-point statistics by
> design but are rather different morphologically. The choice of these
> microstructures is driven by their wide use in several practical problems
> ranging from polymers to geomaterials. The first microstructure is obtained by
> a random sequential adsorption (RSA) of non-overlapping, polydisperse,
> spherical and ellipsoidal voids oriented randomly in a unit-cell. The second
> one, termed connected random sequential adsorption (CRSA), is obtained from
> the first one by adding controlled connectivity via cylindrical channels of
> circular cross-section. The porosity resulting from connectivity is
> compensated by reducing the size of the existing voids to have the same
> overall porosity. Interestingly, we find that connectivity does not affect the
> corresponding two-point statistics. Finally, using as an input the numerical
> one- and two-point correlations of the RSA, we reconstruct a thresholded
> Gaussian random field (TGRF) microstructure. Using FFT numerical simulations,
> we show that the resulting effective elastic properties are very different for
> the three generated microstructures, despite them sharing nearly the same
> two-point correlation functions. We show, further, that the introduction of
> connectivity, and in particular the partial volume fraction of the connected
> channels, even small, affects strongly the resulting effective elasticity of
> the composite.
