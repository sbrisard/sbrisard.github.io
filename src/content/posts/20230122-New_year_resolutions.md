So it is again this time of year where you make a few pledges that you soon
forget about. I am no exception to this rule, and formed three New Year
Resolutions to date.

# New Year Resolution \#1: make more of my work public

This blog is of course a very nice medium to publicize some of my work. It has
lately been, erhhh, dormant… to say the least! That does not mean that I've been
idle, but I am currently working on larger projects, that are more akin to open
books. There are three of them.

The first open book I am working on is [An introduction to Lippmann–Schwinger
solvers](https://github.com/sbrisard/LS-intro), that discusses the so-called
“FFT-based numerical solvers for homogenization” first introduced by Moulinec
and Suquet (1994, [1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0045-7825(97)00218-1)). I
started to write these notes in September 2021 as a LaTeX document. They are
meant to deliver the theoretical background that using my own implementation of
these solvers requires (see [Scapin.jl](https://github.com/sbrisard/Scapin.jl) –
still work in progress!).

In march 2022, my colleagues [Matti
Schneider](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matti-Schneider), [François
Willot](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francois-Willot) and I organized a
week-long workshop on this topic: [Introduction to FFT-based numerical methods
for the homogenization of random
materials](https://fft-workshop-22.sciencesconf.org/). The
[slides](https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03631887) and videos are
available on HAL. I was quite happy with some pedagogical choices I made for
this workshop and will start from this notes to update my open book.

I am working very actively on the second open book, [Notes on the
Lyapunov–Schmidt–Koiter asymptotic method](https://sbrisard.github.io/LSK). I
have always been intrigued by Koiter's work but never took the time to dig into
it. In october 2021, as a side project, I decided I would regularly devote some
time to deeply understanding this framework. This turned out to be an extremely
enjoyable journey, but also a painful one at times. More than one year later, I
have started to develop my own understanding of the LSK framework. Although
there are some points that are still unclear to me, I thought I would share
these notes.

Finally, I started work on my *Lecture notes on the plates and shells theory* in
august 2017. I have since been working on it actively, although not
publicly. This is a very demanding work (1750h so far!) and you will have to be
patient, as I will release no preview until I am happy with the whole thing.

Note that since the beginning of this year, I have started to use a great
publishing tool called [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It's really well thought,
powerful and easy to use. I intend to convert all my open books to the Quarto
format.

# New Year Resolution \#2: publish in overlay journals…

…at least when students (or other collaborators that might be negatively
affected by such a choice) are not involved.

The *Journal of Theoretical, Computational and Applied Mechanics* is a rather
new overlay journal (first papers published in 2021). The whole thing is very
nicely done: the review process is public, the template is good-looking, and the
“JTCAM LaTeX template for preprints” and related “Instructions for Paper
Submission” are a model of useful information very nicely put together.

With my colleagues [Kaïs Ammar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kais-Ammar)
and [Samuel Forest](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samuel-Forest), we
intend to soon submit a paper to this journal. I can't wait!

# New Year Resolution \#3: revive this blog!

This one will be difficult to keep. In fact, I was recently contacted by Antonio
Rodriguez-Ferran (UPC-BarcelonaTech), who kindly sent these words

> I found your blog in a google search for “bulk modulus in two
> dimensions”. Your three-part post on “Elastic constants of an isotropic
> material” was extremely helpful: it contains the level of detail I was looking
> for, and it is remarkably clear. Thanks a lot for making this nice material
> available to the community!

Antonio also mentioned a couple of typos, which I am grateful for!

Anyway, I took this message as an encouragement to write more. I was actually
quite happy with my last (unfinished) series on “What is Homogenization?” and
should probably pick it up where I left it a year and a half ago.

Note that I would also like to change this blog into a proper website, were my
various series would be gathered into proper pages (rather than span multiple
posts). That would probably make them easier to discover. The *blog* section
would be devoted to more informal news (like this post).

Revamping this blog however represents a decent amount of work and I am not sure
I can really find the time for that. Also, I would be reluctant to break
previously existing links to my posts, since some of them are apparently already
indexed by Google (with no permalink, unfortunately). If I decide to take on
this challenge, I will of course use this great [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
tool I already mentioned.

# Closing words

Jacques Chirac once said “les promesses n'engagent que ceux qui les reçoivent”…
I am sure that even if you do not speak french, you get the spirit!
