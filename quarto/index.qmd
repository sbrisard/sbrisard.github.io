You’ve reached the blog of Sébastien Brisard. My most recent posts are listed
below. If you are wondering why this blog is relatively “low-tech”, read the
[“About this blog” ](about.qmd) section.

Please also visit the documentation of some of my projects

- <https://sbrisard.github.io/janus>: the documentation of the `Janus` library,
- <https://sbrisard.github.io/pw85>: the documentation of the `PW85` library.

as well as some recent (work in progress) open books

- [An introduction to Lippmann–Schwinger solvers](https://github.com/sbrisard/LS-intro)
- [Notes on the Lyapunov–Schmidt–Koiter asymptotic method](https://sbrisard.github.io/LSK)

Enjoy reading!
