In the [previous
instalment]({filename}20180212-On_the_periodic-plus-smooth_decomposition_of_an_image-01.md)
of this series, we discussed the need for periodic images. Although not all
images are periodic, some image analysis techniques are best performed in
Fourier space (using the fast Fourier transform). Applying Fourier-based
techniques to images that are *not* periodic (as is often the case) generates
artifacts. In order to reduce these artifacts, Moisan
([2011](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-010-0227-1)) proposed to construct a
periodic image that is as close as possible to the original image. For reasons
that will become clearer in the remainder of this post, he called the resulting
construction the “periodic-plus-smooth decomposition”. We will define this
decomposition in the remainder of this post, which is the second in a series in
seven parts:

<<<toc.md.in>>>

As an appetizer, [Fig. 1](#fig01) shows the original image (left) and its
periodic (middle) and smooth components (right). Gray levels of the smooth
component have been rescaled so as to fit between 0 and 255.  Most of this image
is grayish, meaning it is zero almost everywhere, except at the boundaries,
where it corrects the jumps induced by the lack of periodicity of the initial
image.

## The decomposition as a minimization problem

Let $u$ be a $m\times n$ image. We want to find two images $p$ (“periodic”
component) and $s$ (“smooth” component), such that $u=p+s$ and

1. $p$ minimizes jumps across boundaries (periodicity),
2. $s$ minimizes jumps between neighbor pixels (smoothness),
3. $p$ and $u$ have same mean value (conservation of brigthness).

In Moisan's work, neighbor pixels refer to the
[4-connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_connectivity#4-connected).
Furthermore, we define

- *direct* neighbors, that are adjacent to the pixel under consideration
- *indirect* neighbors, that are periodic images of these neigbors that would
  normally fall outside the image.

[Fig. 2](#fig02) illustrates direct and indirect neighbors. It shows that

- corner pixels have 2 direct neighbors and 2 indirect neighbors,
- off-corner, boundary pixels have 3 direct neighbors and 1 indirect neighbor,
- off-boundary (inner) pixels have 4 direct neighbors.

corner pixels (orange, top row), off-corner, boundary pixels (orange, middle
row) and off-boundary pixels (orange, bottom row).</figcaption>

Now, we need to quantify how periodic is $p$, and how smooth is $s$. To do so,
we will define two energy functions: $E_\mathrm p$ and $E_\mathrm s$ that
penalize lack of periodicity and smoothness, respectively. More precisely,
$E_\mathrm p$ (resp. $E_\mathrm s$) is greater for less periodic (resp. less
smooth) $p$ (resp. $s$). The periodic-plus-smooth decomposition of an image $u$
is then defined as the pair of images $(p, s)$ that minimize the total energy
$E(p, s)=E_\mathrm p(p)+E_\mathrm s(s)$ under the constraints $u=p+s$ and
$\operatorname{mean}(s)=0$. The remainder of this post is dedicated to defining
the energies $E_\mathrm p$ and $E_\mathrm s$.

## How to penalize lack of periodicity?

For each pixel located at the boundary of an image, we compute the sum of
squared differences (SSD) with *indirect* neighbors. The sum of all these SSDs
is the energy of the periodic component. Note that *direct* neighbors are
excluded from this sum, as we focus here on the jumps across image
boundaries. This leads to the following expression

$$E_\mathrm p(p)=\underbrace{(p_{m-1, 0}-p_{0, 0})^2+(p_{0, n-1}-p_{0, 0})^2}\_\text{top-left corner}$$
$$+\underbrace{(p_{0, 0}-p_{0, n-1})^2+(p_{m-1, n-1}-p_{0, n-1})^2}\_\text{top-right corner}$$
$$+\underbrace{(p_{0, 0}-p_{m-1, 0})^2+(p_{m-1, n-1}-p_{m-1, 0})^2}\_\text{bottom-left corner}$$
$$+\underbrace{(p_{0, n-1}-p_{m-1, n-1})^2+(p_{m-1, 0}-p_{m-1, n-1})^2}\_\text{bottom-right corner}$$
$$+\underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{m-2}(p_{i, n-1}-p_{i, 0})^2}\_\text{left column}+\underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{m-2}(p_{i, 0}-p_{i, n-1})^2}\_\text{right column}$$
$$+\underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^{n-2}(p_{m-1, j}-p_{0, j})^2}\_\text{top row}+\underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^{n-2}(p_{0, j}-p_{m-1, j})^2}\_\text{bottom row},$$

which reduces to

$$E_\mathrm p(p)=2\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}(p_{i, n-1}-p_{i, 0})^2+2\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}(p_{m-1, j}-p_{0, j})^2.$$

## How to penalize lack of smoothness?

At this point, you might have guessed that smoothness is measured through the
sum of squared differences between *direct* neighbors

$$E_\mathrm s(s)=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\bigl[(s_{i, j-1}-s_{i, j})^2+(s_{i, j+1}-s_{i, j})^2+(s_{i-1, j}-s_{i, j})^2+(s_{i+1, j}-s_{i, j})^2\bigr],$$

where we have defined the following ghost cells

$$s_{i, -1}=s_{i, 0}, \quad s_{i, n}=s_{i, n-1}, \quad s_{-1, j}=s_{0, j}
\quad\text{and}\quad s_{m, j}=s_{m-1, j},$$

in order to make sure that indirect neighbors are indeed excluded. It is
readily observed that in the above sum, each pair of direct neighbors
appears exactly twice. In other words,

$$E_\mathrm s(s)=2\sum_{i=0}^{m-2}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}(s_{i+1, j}-s_{i, j})^2
+2\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\sum_{j=0}^{n-2}(s_{i, j+1}-s_{i, j})^2.$$

## Python implementation

Implementation of the total energy $E(p, s)=E_\mathrm p(p)+E_\mathrm s(s)$ is
fairly trivial (note the use of the `broadcast_arrays` function).

``` {.python}
def ssd(a, b):
    """Sum of squared differences."""
    delta2 = b-a
    delta2 *= delta2
    return np.sum(delta2)


def energy(p, s):
    """Return the total energy of the periodic-plus-smooth decomposition.

    The periodic and smooth components p and s are 2D arrays of
    float64. They should have the same shape, although this is not
    required by this function.  2D arrays.

    The energy is defined in Moisan (2011), Theorem 1. The
    contribution of the periodic component is

        E_p(p) = sum sum [p(x)-p(y)]**2,
                  x   y

    where the first sum is carried over all boundary pixels x, and the
    second sum is carried over the indirect neighbors y of x. The
    contribution of the smooth component is

        E_s(s) = sum sum [s(x)-s(y)]**2,
                  x   y

    where the first sum is carried over all pixels x, and the second
    sum is carried over the direct neighbors y of x. The total energy
    is then defined as

        E(p, s) = E_p(p) + E_s(s).
    """
    p, s = np.broadcast_arrays(p, s)
    return 2*(ssd(p[:, 0], p[:, -1]) +
              ssd(p[0, :], p[-1, :]) +
              ssd(s[:-1, :], s[1:, :]) +
              ssd(s[:, :-1], s[:, 1:]))

```

## An equivalent, unconstrained minimization problem

The periodic-plus-smooth decomposition $(p, s)$ of an image $u$ is defined as
the minimizer of the above defined energy $E(p, s)$, under the constraints:
$u=p+s$ and $\operatorname{mean}s=0$. Moisan
([2011](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-010-0227-1)) reformulates this
constrained minimization problem as the following unconstrained minimization
problem

$$s=\operatorname*{arg\,min}\_v F(v, u),
\quad\text{with}\quad
F(s, u)=E_\mathrm p(u-s)+E_\mathrm s(s)+(\operatorname{mean}s)^2,$$

and the periodic component $p$ reads: $p=u-s$. This is the minimization problem
that we will eventually solve.

## Conclusion

In the present post, we have defined the periodic-plus-smooth decomposition as
the minimizer of Moisan's energy, under the constraint that the average gray
level of the periodic component is equal to the average gray level of the
initial image.

Moisan ([2011](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-010-0227-1)) showed that this
minimizer is explicit in Fourier space. In the [next
instalment]({filename}20180226-On_the_periodic-plus-smooth_decomposition_of_an_image-03.md)
of this series, we will however temporarily ignore this result, and optimize the
total energy in the real space, using standard iterative techniques. This will
allow us to generate reference decompositions that will eventually be used to
set up unit tests in order to check our implementation of Moisan's method.
