In this series, I will explore the notion of orientational order in random
packings of anisotropic (flat or elongated), hard particles. By orientational
order, I mean that particles which are close to each other tend to adopt the
same orientation. This leads to strong *local* anisotropy, while the packing may
well be *globally* isotropic; in particular, all orientations of single grains
are equiprobable. Local orientational order is stronger when the volume fraction
of particles, or their aspect ratio increases.

Local orientational order will be illustrated on a “real” packing, and I chose
rice grains for this demo. Analysis of orientation correlations requires to go
through the following steps

1. acquisition of a 3D image of the packing through X-ray microtomography,
2. segmentation of the 3D image (each grain must be labelled individually) by
   means of the [Population](http://www.population-image.fr/) C++ library,
3. computation of the orientation of each rice grain, using the `scipy.ndimage`
   Python module,
4. computation of the orientation correlations.

Before we proceed, I would like to clarify the notion of local orientational
order through images of synthetic packings of 10000 hard (flat) spheroids. The
aspect ratio (ratio of polar to equatorial radii) of the (flat) spheroids is
0.125. The images below (click to enlarge) are three realizations of random
packing of spheroids, at 40% (left), 50% (middle) and 60% (right) volume
fraction. The color of each particle is chosen according to its orientation, so
that particles with similar colors have similar orientations.

It should be mentioned that generating such compact assemblies is no trivial
task. The event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm proposed by Donev, Torquato
and Stillinger ([2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2004.08.014),
[2005a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2004.08.025)) is an attractive option: it
is both very general and versatile. It is however a bit complex, and I adopted a
different approach, which we published a while ago with Pierre Levitz ([Brisard
and Levitz, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.87.013305)). In a nutshell,
the microstructures presented above are the result of a kind of [Reverse
Monte-Carlo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Monte_Carlo) simulation with a
non-physical pairwise potential. The interaction potential is zero when the
spheroids do not intersect, and repulsive when they do.

It is observed that, as the volume fraction of particles increases, so does the
size of the color patches. In other words, to pack the particles closely, you
need to stack them! Mathematically speaking, the orientations of particles
exhibit long-range correlations. In the next instalments of this series, I will
show how these correlations can be quantified, both on synthetic and
\"real-life\" samples.
