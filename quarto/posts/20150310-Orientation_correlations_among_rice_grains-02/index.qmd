title: "Orientation correlations among rice grains, part 2: acquisition of tomography images"

In the
[first](../20150223-Orientation_correlations_among_rice_grains-01)
instalment of this series, I briefly introduced orientational order in
assemblies of anisotropic particles, and proposed an illustration based on
synthetic microstructures. But what I really intend to do in this series is to
show how orientational order can be quantified in a “real-life” sample, namely a
packing of rice grains. This of course requires a 3D image of the
packing. Fortunately, my lab ([Laboratoire Navier](http://navier.enpc.fr/)) is
the proud host of a [collaborative microtomography
platform](http://navier.enpc.fr/Microtomographe,297) and my former colleague
Nicolas Lenoir – who was in charge of this instrument – gave me the opportunity
to scan my toy sample in december 2013.

The sample preparation is rather crude. Ordinary, long-grain rice is poured in a
plastic container (see picture below), 50mm in diameter. The average length of
the grains is about 6.5mm as the image analysis to come will show. Therefore,
strong boundary effects are to be expected.  This is no big issue for the
present study, which is carried out for illustrative purposes only.

Two X-ray sources are available at Laboratoire Navier. For the present
experiment, we used the [Hamamatsu
L10801](http://www.hamamatsu.com/resources/pdf/etd/MFX_TXPR1007E01.pdf) X-ray
source (maximum voltage: 230V, maximum current: 1mA). Combined with the the
[Paxscan Varian
2520V](http://www.varian.com/media/xray/products/pdf/ps2520d.pdf) flat-panel
X-ray imager (1536x1920 pixels, pixel pitch 127µm), this setup leads to a voxel
size of approx. 0.030mm. The specimen was scanned at 100kV and 300µA with an
imager frame-rate of 6 images per second. To reduce noise, 12 radiographs were
averaged to produce one projection; the total number of projections was 1440
(see below a typical projection).

3D reconstruction was carried out using standard tools developed by [RX
Solutions France](http://www.rxsolutions.fr/). Contrast, resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio were all excellent, so that the most basic reconstruction
procedure resulted in very high quality 3D images (see three orthogonal slices
below).

The reconstruction is highly contrasted, so that simple thresholding should
produce a very convincing segmentation. This will be the topic of the next
instalments. But we first take a break to discuss [binning of the
images](../20150330-Orientation_correlations_among_rice_grains-03).

## Acknowledgements

The present series would not exist without the help of my former colleague
Nicolas Lenoir, now research engineer at
[PLACAMAT](http://www.placamat.cnrs.fr/). His dedication and excellent temper
made 3D imaging at Laboratoire Navier a real delight. He also kindly agreed to
review this post, which I am grateful for, since he spotted some rather crude
mistakes!

[Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/) was used to produce the last image of this
post.

## Update (2017-05-25)

The 3D reconstruction is now available from the [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
platform as a set of 689 TIFF images, 1747×1751 pixels, under a [CC BY
