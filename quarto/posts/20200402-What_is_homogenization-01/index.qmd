Most of my research activities deal with upscaling the mechanical
properties of heterogeneous materials. This is also known as
homogenization. So what *is* homogenization? This series explores this
question; it is largely based on the introduction to my [Habilitation
defense](file:./20171117-Announcing_the_defense_of_my_habilitation.org).

In order to introduce homogenization, we will draw inspiration from
the publishing industry. The following photograph[^1] was published
in *Le Journal* (a french daily newspaper) from thursday, may
30<sup>th</sup>, 1935. It illustrates the first cruise of the ocean
liner [Normandie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Normandie).

From where you sit, water exhibits nice shades of gray. However, let
us take a closer look at the prow:

It turns out that the sea has a *dotted* structure, which is inherent
to the so-called [halftoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone)
technique itself. Of course, the reason why the resulting picture
looks fine is because you are looking at it from far off. Also, the
size of the “gray” patches must be large enough for you to get the
illusion that it is smoothly shaded. Indeed, if the patch contains
only a few dots, the illusion will not take place.

We have therefore identified three length-scales

- the *microscopic* length-scale $L_μ$ is the size of the dots,
- the *mesoscopic* length-scale $L_{\mathrm{m}}$ is the typical size
  of the patches,
- the *macroscopic* length-scale $L_{\mathrm{M}}$ is the distance
  from your screen to your eye.

These three scales must be well separated for the photograph to appear
smoothly shaded. In other words, the macro scale is much larger than
the meso scale, which in turn is much larger than the micro scale:
$L_μ ≪ L_{\mathrm{m}} ≪ L_{\mathrm{M}}$. This is the
so-called assumption of *separation of scales*.

Provided that separation of scales prevails, homogenization can take
place. Homogenization is the process of replacing the complex
microstructure with an equivalent, *homogeneous* mesostructure. By
*microstructure*, we mean both the geometry and physical properties of
the microscopic features. In the above example, the microstructure is
defined by the size and spacing of the dots (geometry), as well as the
color of dots and background (physical properties). The
*mesostructure* on the other hand is a patch with homogeneous,
equivalent (in homogenization language, we say *effective*)
properties. In the above example, the effective property is the shade
of gray as perceived by the observer.

## Conclusion

In this post, we introduced the homogenization concept through a
graphical analogy. We explained that the key ingredient for
homogenization to be valid is separation of scales.

In the [next
instalment]({filename}20200408-What_is_homogenization-02.md) of this
series, we will discuss two strategies to carry out homogenization:
the bottom-up and top-down approaches.
