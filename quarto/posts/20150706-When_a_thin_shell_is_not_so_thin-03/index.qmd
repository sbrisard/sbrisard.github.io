Finding the stress resultant and stress couple in a spherical pressure vessel
seems easy enough. Well, this apparently simple problem allows us to highlight
subtle thickness effects within shells. It should be emphasized again that these
thickness effects have nothing to do with shear corrections. Indeed, shear
stresses are null at any point of the spherical pressure vessel. Rather, the
thickness effects we are discussing in this series are due to curvature.

In the [first instalment](../20150608-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-01) of
this series, I showed that using Koiter's thin shell solution leads to a
non-null stress couple, which came as quite a surprise. In the [second
instalment](../20150701-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-02), I used the exact,
3D solution to derive reference values of the stress couple and stress resultant
through integration over the thickness of the shell. In particular, I showed
that thickness corrections *had* to be incorporated.

This still does not settle the matter, since the results obtained within the
framework of Koiter's thin shell theory (see [first
instalment](../20150608-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-01)) are inconsistent
with the reference, 3D elasticity values (see [second
instalment](../20150701-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-02)). To reconcile both
approaches (3D elasticity vs. shell theory), we need to use a *thick* shell
theory, as illustrated below.


# Strain distribution in the spherical pressure vessel

The fundamental assumption of all shell theories is that displacement of any
point of the shell is completely defined by the rigid body motion (translation
and rotation) of its projection onto the base surface. In the present case,
owing to the symmetries of the problem, points of the base surface move along
the normal $\mathbf n$
$$
\mathbf u = w\mathbf n,
$$ {#eq-01}
where $w$ is the normal displacement, which is constant over the base
surface. Since the rotation is null, all points (across the thickness of the
shell) have the same normal displacement. Therefore, Eq. (@eq-01) defines the 3D
displacement field within the shell, seen as a 3D continuum. From this 3D
displacement field, we can readily derive the corresponding strain field. We
will use a simplified, geometric approach, rather than the general formulas in
spherical coordinates.  This is possible because there are so many symmetries in
the problem at hand!

The in-plane strain $\epsilon$ at the distance $r$ of the center is given by the
relative change of length of the equator
$$
\epsilon=\frac{2\pi\bigl(r+w\bigr)-2\pi r}{2\pi r}=\frac wr.
$$ {#eq-02}

In the [first instalment](../20150608-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-01), we
found $\epsilon=w/R$, where $R$ is the radius of the midsurface. Eq. (@eq-02)
therefore incorporates thickness corrections which we previously overlooked.


# Stress distribution in the spherical pressure vessel

Stresses in the spherical pressure vessel are derived from the strains \[see
Eq. (@eq-02)\], within the framework of plane stress elasticity
$$
\sigma\_{\theta\theta}=\frac E{1-\nu^2}\bigl(\epsilon\_{\theta\theta}+\nu\epsilon\_{\phi\phi}\bigr)
$$ {#eq-03}
$$
\sigma\_{\phi\phi}=\frac E{1-\nu^2}\bigl(\epsilon\_{\phi\phi}+\nu\epsilon\_{\theta\theta}\bigr).
$$ {#eq-04}

Since the solution is isotropic
($\epsilon\_{\theta\theta}=\epsilon\_{\phi\phi}=\epsilon$ and
$\sigma\_{\theta\theta}=\sigma\_{\phi\phi}=\sigma$), Eqs. (@eq-03) and (@eq-04)
lead to
$$
\sigma=\frac E{1-\nu}\epsilon=\frac E{1-\nu}\frac wr.
$$ {#eq-05}


# Stress resultant and stress couple

Eq. (@eq-05) is finally integrated over the thickness of the shell to obtain the
stress resultant and stress couple. Integration must include thickness
corrections, which amount to a $r/R$ factor within the integral (see [previous
instalment](../20150701-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-02) of this series).

$$
N=\int\_{R\_\mathrm{int}}^{R\_\mathrm{ext}}\sigma(r)\,\frac rR\,\mathrm{d}r=\frac{Eh}{1-\nu}\frac wR,
$$ {#eq-06}
$$
M=\int\_{R\_\mathrm{int}}^{R\_\mathrm{ext}}-\bigl(r-R\bigr)\sigma(r)\,\frac rR\,\mathrm{d}r=0.
$$ {#eq-07}

Now, things start getting really interesting! Indeed, in the thick shell
approach, the stress couple is (as expected) rigorously null! Since $M=0$, it
can readily be deduced that
$$
N=\frac{pR}2.
$$ {eq-08}

In other words, the classical formula is retrieved (see
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_vessel#Stress_in_thin-walled_pressure_vessels)).


# Conclusion

In the present post, we finally resolved all contradictions regarding the
computation of stress resultant and stress couple within a spherical pressure
vessel. In the discussion below, $\eta$ denotes the slenderness of the shell,
$\eta=h/R$. Besides, by “k-th order terms”, we mean terms of order $\eta^k$.

Four difference approaches can be followed to analyse the equilibrium of a
spherical pressure vessel (see table below). In the classical membrane approach,
stress couples are overlooked, and the classical formula $N=pR/2$ is obtained.

In the thin shell approach, the stress resultant deviates slightly from this
classical value (by second order terms) and the stress couple is *not* null
(rather, it is of second order).

In the thick shell approach, the stress couple is rigorously null and the
classical formula is retrieved for the stress resultant. Thickness corrections
appear in two different places

1. in the strain distribution across the thickness of the shell [see
   Eq. (@eq-02)]: the distribution is hyperbolic with respect to the thickness
   coordinate,
2. in the stress-stress resultant and stress-stress couple integral relations
   [see Eqs. (@eq-06) and (@eq-07)].

In the 3D approach, the true stress resultant differs from $N=pR/2$ by second
order terms, while the true stress couple is of fourth order.

What should we deduce from this study? Obviously, beware thin shell theories!
Fortunately, I believe that most FE codes implement the thick shell theory. More
fundamentally, I am still trying to understand what these results really
imply. Does that mean that the asymptotic convergence (as the thickness tends to
zero) of thick shell models is faster than that of thin shell models? That is
something I am going to investigate.

This closes our series on thick shells. I hope you enjoyed reading it…  and
maybe learned something! Should you want to dig deeper into various thick shell
theories, do start with Leissa

overview.
